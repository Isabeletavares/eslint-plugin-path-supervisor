## Features

- **Absolute and Relative Path Enforcement**: Ensure that your imports use the correct path type.
- **Public API Imports**: Easily manage and validate imports from your public API.
- **Customizable Rules**: Tailor the rules to fit your project's needs.
- **Integration with ESLint**: Works seamlessly with your existing ESLint setup.

## Installation

To install the plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install eslint-plugin-path-supervisor --save-dev
```

This command adds the plugin to your development dependencies. Once installed, you can start using it in your ESLint configuration.

## Usage

To use the plugin, you need to add it to your ESLint configuration file. Here‚Äôs how you can do that:

1. Open your ESLint configuration file (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`).
2. Add `path-supervisor` to the `plugins` section.
3. Enable the rules you want to use.

Here‚Äôs an example configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        'path-supervisor'
    ],
    rules: {
        'path-supervisor/absolute-paths': 'error',
        'path-supervisor/public-api-imports': 'warn'
    }
};
```

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the plugin by modifying the rules in your ESLint configuration. Each rule comes with its own set of options, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs.

For example, you can set the `absolute-paths` rule to allow certain directories:

```javascript
rules: {
    'path-supervisor/absolute-paths': ['error', { allow: ['src', 'lib'] }]
}
```

## Rules

The plugin includes several rules to help you manage your imports effectively. Here are some of the key rules:

- **absolute-paths**: Enforces the use of absolute paths in imports.
- **relative-paths**: Enforces the use of relative paths in imports.
- **public-api-imports**: Validates imports from your public API.

Each rule can be configured with specific options to meet your project requirements.
